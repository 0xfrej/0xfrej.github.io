Hi there! My name is Freja. I am a software engineer currently working mostly on ecommerce platforms.
I use mainly PHP in my day-to-day job, but I don't hesitate from using a better suited language for when the task 
requires it. Except PHP, I like to utilize Go and for personal hobby projects I use C/C++, Rust and a tiny bit of C#.

I am interested in software architecture and DDD

My experience:
- K8S and GCP savvy
- Docker
- Google Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ
- Symfony
- Magento 2
- Shopify
- Akeneo
- Terraform
- Go

Some more info in short points (everybody likes those, right?):
- I like to dig into OS, language interpreters and compilers, and other fun stuff
- Love photography, sewing, coffee brewing
- I use neovim btw (I am new and suck at it still so don't judge me too harsly)
- I have a Shiba Inu
